📘 TRANSVERSALPROJECTS

Final project for the course Transversal Projects, focused on building a DApp for academic attendance recording using blockchain technology.

🛠️ Technologies Used

    Solidity – smart contract development (EventoPresenca.sol)

    HTML + JavaScript – frontend interface for MetaMask interaction
