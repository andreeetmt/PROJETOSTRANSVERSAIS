📘 TRANSVERSALPROJECTS

Final project for the course Transversal Projects, focused on building a DApp for academic attendance recording using blockchain technology.

🚀 About the Project

This project is a DApp designed for practical academic verification. Each university event generates a unique smart contract address, which interacts with the participant’s wallet (MetaMask), ensuring their attendance is securely and permanently recorded on the blockchain.

🛠️ Technologies Used

    Solidity – smart contract development (EventoPresenca.sol)
    GitHub Pages – free hosting for the DApp
    HTML + JavaScript – frontend interface for MetaMask interaction
    ether.js- library for connecting the interface to smart contract

📄 Features

    Attendance registration via MetaMask transaction
    Emits a PresencaRegistrada event upon successful registration
    Allows public retrieval of registered data (obterComprovante())
    Checks if a wallet has already registered (jaCompareceu())
