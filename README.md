# PROJETOS TRANSVERSAIS
📘 TRANSVERSALPROJECTS

Final project for the course Transversal Projects, focused on building a DApp for academic attendance recording using blockchain technology.

🚀 About the Project

This project is a DApp designed for practical academic verification. Each university event generates a unique smart contract address, which interacts with the participant’s wallet (MetaMask), ensuring their attendance is securely and permanently recorded on the blockchain.
